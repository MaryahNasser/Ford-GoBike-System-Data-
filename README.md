## Introduction:
This is data analyst project required  to pass Udacity Nanodegree program. I used Jupyter notebook and data visualization libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib, and seaborn to explore the dataset. 

## Exploration:
I made various types of graphs depend on types of compartion variables i had.
<ul>
<li><p>Bar chart and pie chart for qualitative univariant variable</p></li>
<li><p>Histogram for quantitive univariant variable</p></li>
<li><p>Scatterplot for quantitive bivariant variable and multivariant variables</p></li>
<li><p>Heatmap for qualitative Bivariant variable</p></li>
<li><p>Boxplot for qualitative VS quantitive variables</p></li>
</ul>

## Key Observations:

<ol>
<li>most of the riders was subscribers of the company.</li>
<li>74% of riders were male. However, only 23 were female and 2% from other.</li>
<li>Male subscriber triple the number of female subscriber</li>
<li>People around age 30 tend to take the longest rides. Also; the older they became, the less ride duration they did.</li>
